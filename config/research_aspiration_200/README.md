# Research — +200%/month aspiration (simulation-only)

Per `docs/plan.md`, **+200% per calendar month** is an *aspiration*, not the
iter30 rolling-window promotion gate. This directory holds **explicitly
aggressive, simulation-only** YAML stacks that loosen sizing within plan
§A guardrails (no martingale, no averaging down, no lookahead, no news
strategies) to answer: *is the ceiling risk/sizing or signal quality?*

**Do not deploy these as the HFM baseline** without a separate review. They
exist to push the search frontier and log honest metrics.

See `scripts/iter34_moonshot_sweep.py` for a bounded grid over members of
this family.

## Result snapshot (2026-01..04 M1, same CSV as other iter runs)

| Config | best month % | full % | cap viol | ruin |
|--------|-------------:|-------:|:--------:|:----:|
| `moonshot_pivot_daily_r18_tp9` | **~275** (Feb, +274.98%) | ~691 | 4 | no |
| `moonshot_pivot_daily_r10` | ~83.5 (Mar) | ~210 | 2 | no |
| `moonshot_squeeze_lon_r15` / dual ensemble | negative | deep loss | many | yes |

**Interpretation:** the +200%/month bar can be exceeded in a *single* month
in-sample by a lone high-risk `pivot_bounce` with long TP2; the same recipe
still has bad months, cap hits, and is not walk-forward safe. Treat as a
ceiling probe, not a live candidate.
